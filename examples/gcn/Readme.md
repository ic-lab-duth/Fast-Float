### Graph Convolutional Network
GCN example refers to the inference of a Graph Convolutional Network for node classification, using the Cora, Citeseer or Pubmed dataset as provided by Thomas Kipf [here](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn/tree/master/gcn/data). 

Currently the code is set to execute inference on Citeseer dataset. To change the dataset you can comment out the appropriate lines in "defs.h" and "gcn_tb.cpp. The part of the code that corresponds to each application is clearly defined in the code.
